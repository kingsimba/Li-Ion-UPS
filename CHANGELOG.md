CHANGELOG
=========

# 2025-02-15 REV3

* Submit to production for 20 PCs
* By default, disable Thermoistor.
* Adjust charging maximum voltage from 12.6V to 12.4V, to give some room for resistor precision.

# 2025-02-10 REV2

* Adjust charger current to 1A.
* Change output connector.
* Improved Buck converter efficiency: adjust LDO to 10V to drive MOSFET better.

# 2025-01-28 REV1

First Version:

* Use a buck converter to get 24V V_ADP. (100V Chip and Mosfet, 75V TVS)
* Use a battery charger chip to charge battery. 3A constant currentï¼Œ up to 12V.
